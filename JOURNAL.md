now I am planning to make a cavity for screen (OLED for sure) wires through this and the actual load cell will be underneath the plate with the micro controller (might be a esp)

## 10/20/2025 - There was a Error in the Print file   

The Cavity was too close to the outer wall and hence it broke of there so the man who prints fixed it some putty and the Print Quality is awesome. It dosen't feel like any Plastic ![WhatsApp Image 2025-10-20 at 13.52.56_f1cac08e.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzY5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ed8fb91c5ba389ace27fe0458f4705d263daade2/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-10-20%20at%2013.52.56_f1cac08e.jpg)
